# Motivation

## Because Electron sucks
I could sit here and rant about electron the whole day, so I'll just link you to this article instead

[Electron is flash for the desktop](https://josephg.com/blog/electron-is-flash-for-the-desktop/)
## We dont need a GUI anyway

Well, we do, and we don't, this is tricky to explain but think of it this way, imagine running 50 bots on your computer (or a server), you don't actually need to keep a gui open in order for them to work, and you definitely need a way to control all those bots, so, how does that work? Difys.

One of the core motivation for difys is to be run somewhere else and to minimize the cost of computing, while in the same time expose an api to both send AND request data.

**Note**: we are still going to make a gui (both web and mobile), but it won't be made to be explicitly run on the same machine difys is running.
## Open-source benefits everyone

There are no open source botting clients out there, atleast no clients that I'm aware of.

>We had a conversation about this before I started difys, making something open source is nice and all, it got it ups and downs, you sure get the help of the community and it helps you build a better project, but in the same time you are exposing your code for others to edit and benefit from it privately, I dont see it as a bad thing because it was my choice in the beginning to make the project open source, I did that knowing the downs and I accepted them, as much as I want people to help, I also want them to make a better version, now, I did license it under [GPL 3.0](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/) tho, which means that every public version that came from difys MUST be opensource.

>TL DR: I know it sucks for people to use your code and make a better private version of it, but I knew that in the beginning and I accepted it, I cant whine about it now or close the source later when no one is contributing publicly
(plus the whole idea of plugins is to make it easier for people to add functionalities and to share them with eachothers, publicly or not)

We want, but we do not expect people to contribute, if you want to help, we will gladly appreciate it. We see opensource as a way for the community to build something great, and opensource projects never die, even if one of us fall, the source is still available for others to climb and make their own, the only thing we ask you to do is _if it's based on difys_ , license it under [GPLv3](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/)
